It seems that finally this going to be my programming blog. It's been a very long trip to get here. I wasn't
sure enough about writing about programming as a consider myself a learner and nobody would be interested
in the stuff I have to write about.

But here it is. Many thanks to my good friend [Rai][Rai] who tirelessly
teaches me lots of nice stuff about emacs, Lisp, Git, etc. and pushes me to publicly write about programming.

This blog will actually be a way to document the prove of concept that I usually lost so don't expect
to much magic, just simple notes about any prgramming language, but focusing in Erlang and Elixir.

I hope it is interesting...

See soon.
