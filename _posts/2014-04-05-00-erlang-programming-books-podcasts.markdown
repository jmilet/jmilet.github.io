If you are interested in learning Erlang or Elixir the first thing you have to do,
other than install the software, obviously, is go and read this on-line book:

* [Learn Yourself Some Erlang for Great Good][learn_yourserf_some_erlang]

It assumes no previous knowledge of Erlang. It's fun and practical, and also you can buy the
printed copy. I have spent millions of hours with it.

After that the next step could be to read one of the Erlang's author's book:

* [Software for a Concurrent World][software_for_a_concurrent_world]

It focuses in many practical aspects of the language. There you will find an example of how to implement an
OTP (the library that implements most of the distributed, scalable and fault tolerant magic) like server and
how to use Mnesia (the distributed database that comes with the language).

And finally, to master the language and its libraries:

* [Erlang and OTP in Action][erlang_and_otp_in_action]

To acuatlly take advantage of this book you need some knowledge of Erlang. It explains
how to build from the ground up a highly scalable distributed system.

If you want to take full adantatge of your commute time you can subscribe to these podcasts:

* [Mosty Erlang][mostly_erlang]
* [Functional Geekery][functional_geekery]

Two weekly shows about Erlang and other functional programming languages. Both hightly recommended.

Also, not directly related to Erlang, but also very interesting ones are:

* [Ruby Rogues][ruby_rogues]

Not just Ruby, but programming in general.

* [Software Engineering Radio][software_engineering_radio]

Fantastic interview schema with very simple questions... "What a database is?" That, when
answered by clever people produce incredible explanations.

* [NSBrief][nsbrief]

Not related to functional programming but iOS development it's a very interesting podcast.
I learn a lot from it, not just tecnical aspects, but how freelance developers work, how they structure
their work, etc.

That's it.
